# Workshops

In this folder, you will find no fewer than four (4) MCP servers, for use in workshops or in your own learning.
I created each one to be simple, a nice starter project which you can use to teach yourself to play with MCP and to build your own server. With luck, you'll be surprised at how easy it is.

## Contents
* **[deepl-simple-python](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server/tree/main/workshops/deepl-simple-python/)** - a stripped-down, easy-to-understand version of our DeepL MCP server, written (of course) in Python
* **[deepl-simple-js](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server/tree/main/workshops/deepl-simple-js/)** - the same, but in JavaScript
* **[jokes-python](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server/tree/main/workshops/jokes-python/)** - an even simpler MCP server that lets your LLM tell jokes
* **[jokes-js](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-mcp-server/tree/main/workshops/jokes-js/)** - once again, the same, but in JavaScript
